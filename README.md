# Deep Learning in Remote Sensing

<p>This tutorial includes my research, presentations, slides, recommendations and resources for the remote sensing area. </p>
<p>It will be updated and renewed over time. </p><br>

I made a 4 week webinar on this subject. It was for the beginner level on deep learning. The slides and notes were in English, the webinar videos were in Turkish. All slides will be converted to cheat sheet and detailed notes will be added. You can find the presentations and slides below. 

### Episode 1 - Introduction to Deep Learning
